    "A general step in pre-processing a large dataset is to normalize it. In order to do this we subtract by the mean and divide it by the standard deviation. This also allows us to have a standard lambda when we use our regularization technique. This also makes gradient decent run a lot faster and efficiently."

Then we would train the model on the train dataset and get some hypothesis and then measure the error using the development dataset. After doing this we then pick the model with the lowest error on the development set. "
