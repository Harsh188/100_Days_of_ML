    "1. **Encoder**: In this section the model learns how to reduce the input dimensions and compress the input data into an encoded representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bottleneck**: This is a layer that contains the compressed representation fo the input data. It is the lowest possible dimension of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decoder**: In this section the model learns how to reconstruct the data from the encoded representation to be as close to the original output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reconstruction Loss**: In this section the model measures how well the decoder is performing and how close the output is to the original input.\n"
